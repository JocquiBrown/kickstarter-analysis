* This trend also holds true for Plays in the US secifically, with over 50% of them acheiving their crowdfunding goal

* Campaigns that launched in the April-June window had a signficantly higher success rate, while campaigns that launched in December were much more likely to come up short of their goal

* The Median goal for successful US Plays on Kickstarter is only $3000 and the Upper Quartile is only $5000. This means that over 75% of successful plays have a crowdfunding goal less than half of what Louise is asking for. 
* From analyzing failed vs successful campaigns we can see that failed campaigns have goals that are about twice as high as their successful counterparts. 
* However, there is significantly more spread amongst the failed campaigns due to outliers with exorbitant goals. These outliers skewed our mean values and resulted in a higher standard deviation than the mean, indicating that all the campaign goals below our mean values are much closer to the norm.
* Another important thing to note is that pledge amounts were significantly higher for successful campaigns than for failed campaigns, indicating that other factors are also at play when determining the success of a campaign, besides setting overly ambitious goals. 
* For Musicals in Great Britain, the median goal was about $2000, while the median amount pledged (raised) was less than $400! In fact, 75% of the Musicals in Great Britain received less than $1500 in funding.

## Recommendations
* It is recommmeded that Louise starts her Kickstarter campaign for her play in May as most successful campaigns occur during this time. She should avoid launching her campaign during the holiday season, as crowdfunding is lackluster during this time
* Louise should also seriously consider lowering her budget for the play, or at least plan on setting a much more modest goal and making up the difference another way. Louise's budget is higher than that of most failed Play Kickstarters in the US, let alone successful Play campaigns. A goal of about $5000 is much more likely to result in a successful campaign. 
* For her future musical in Great Britain Louise should be even more modest. 75% of all Musicals received less than $1500 in crowdfunding. Loiuse should probably set her goal for less than this amount.
